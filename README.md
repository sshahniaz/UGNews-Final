## Usage

- Extract or git clone it.
- Check ` ./images/fullScreen ` folder and follow the instructions.
- Run using VSCode Live server extension(otherwise, videos don't work).

## Functions 

The Form validation section takes a modular approach, as there are main scripts like `./js/loginScript.js ` and a control script `./controller.js `, where all the form validation happens. The data input is matched with the appropriate REGEX for a given field and, based on success or failure, an array containing a boolean(true/false) and a message regarding where it is invalid or does not match the REGEX. 

> You can find these in `./pages/loginAndReg/js ` folder.

>The code for the slider/carousel can be found at: ` ./js`
